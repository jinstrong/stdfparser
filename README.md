# stdfparser
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/stdfparser
This Repo is originally cloned from code.google.com/p/stdfparser, which is already pretty robust and full. 
I added some more functions so that it makes more meaning and reduces summary & report time.

I am new to ATE and STDF, and I am eager to hear any instruction and/or discussion on related fields.

Thanks,
Jinqiang He
